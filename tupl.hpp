/*
  tupl<T...>
  ==========
  tupl is a C++20 tuple type implemented as struct specializations
  for a variadic number of members T... up to 16 as provided.

  DO NOT EDIT the file 'tupl_impl.hpp'.
  The implementation in tupl_impl.hpp is generated by preprocessing
  the file tupl_dev/tupl_impl_pre.hpp; edit this if you need to.
  If more members are needed then follow instructions in tupl_dev
  to generate a file tupl_dev/tupl_impl.hpp
  
  Depends on <concepts> for assignable_from, ranges::swap CPO, etc.
  Depends on <compare> for three-way operator <=> comparisons, etc.
  (MSVC implementation also depends on <cstdint> for uintptr_t.)

  Depends on lml c_array_support project for generic support of array
  member comparison and assignment, alongside other regular types.
